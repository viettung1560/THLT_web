                Spending time at national parks can be an exciting 
                adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement 
                she was hoping to experience. As she contemplated 
                the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd 
                gotten herself in a little more than she bargained 
                for. It wasn't often that she found herself in a 
                tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were 
                looking to make her their next meal.
